# Church Slides
This is the README for the Church Slides project designed by Darryl Huang.

## About
The code from this repository is deployed on Google Apps Script and is being used for the benefit of the St. Bartholomew's Catholic Church's 11:15 Sunday choir. The combination of HTML and JavaScript allows the programs to generate a music schedule from form input, submit it to a Google Sheet, and can read information from the Google Sheet to generate Google Slides presentations for an entire month.
